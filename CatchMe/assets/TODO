Implement sensitivity, slider or a HIGH/low
	maybe - draw the bucket below as a demo so they can see?
	
Implement falling background
	looping images, that rotate before and after draw to keep up with screen orientation

Global highscores
	Find this permissions file that I need
	Get it working
	Get it integrated with facebook
	
Refactoring
	ditch shape back to sides, so I can change stuff dynamically. If each sode draws itself, i can do things to the square like move sides.
